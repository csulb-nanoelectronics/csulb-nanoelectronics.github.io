        Background
    </h2>
    <p>
        Warming up the cryostat is a procedure where the entire cryostat (including the pulse tubes, variable temperature insert (VTI), probe, magnet) are brought up to room temperature. This is typically done for two main reasons
        <ul>
            <li>
     For annual maintenance on the various cryostat filters, tip seals of the circulation pump, and zeolite trap. 
            </li>
            <li>
                In the event of a power outage or HVAC outage and the compressor and chiller are no longer functioning to keep the cryostat at base temperature ~1.45 K leading to an uncontrolled warm up of not only the sample space but also the pulse tubes and magnet. In the case where the outage has been for a few hours or more and the temperature has risen significantly, it is possible for there to be a loss in vacuum and subsequent contamination of the circulating Helium.

    Step 1. Ramp the magnet to zero field and turn off the magnet switch heater. Cool the VTI to base temperature (~ 1.45 K) and check that the PT2 and magnet temperatures are normal (usually below 4K). 
</b>
    <ol>
        <li>
        To do this, go to the <code>Mercury iPS-M</code> controller (the second box). Navigate the on screen display to return to the home menu. It should appear as in Fig. 1(a). 
        </li>
        <li> If the field value is reading \(B \sim 0.00001 - 0.00004\,\text{T}\), then the field is already set to zero. Else, select the <code>To Zero</code> button on the bottom right of the iPS home menu which will ramp the magnet to zero field. Wait until it reads zero before proceeding. </li> 
        <li>
            If the "switch heater" button is "blued out" then the switch heater is off and we can proceed. Else if it is orange (and says on), then it is on. Press it to turn it off.

        <b> Warnings </b> <br> 
        <p> 
        If the magnet is energized (ie, it has a non-zero field or current running through it), do not turn off the switch heater until the magnet has been ramped down to zero first, else the magnet can undergo a quench. A quench occurs when the temperature of the magnet exceeds its superconducting transition temperature and becomes resistive; this coupled with the typically large amount of current running through the coils leads to a lot of heat/energy being suddenly dissipated. To protect itself, the magnet will then

        Since resistivity versus gate voltage plot for graphene was expected to exhibit a shark peak around the Fermi energy, we tried to fit a "peak" function to the data. We ended up choosing a Lorentzian function, although a Gaussian could work as well (or even a Voigt function which is a convolution of a Gaussian and a Lorentzian). That is, we used a function of the following form
        $$
            L(x) =
            \frac{1}{\pi}
            \frac{\frac{1}{2}\Gamma}{(x-x_0)^2 + (\frac{1}{2}\Gamma)^2} + h
        $$
        with \(\Gamma, x_0, h\) as fittable parameters and fitted it to the scattered points by minimizing the mean square error. In particular, we loaded in the data, which we have stored in CSV form from our LabView output as a <code>Pandas DataFrame</code>. Extracting the array data we then use <code>scipy.optimize.curve_fit</code> to find the parameters that best fit the data and then plot the resulting graphs with <code>Matplotlib.pyplot</code>.

<b><br><br> 
    Step 3. Open the needle valve four full turns from its fully closed position. If a motor driven needle valve is fitted, set this to 99.9%.
</b>

<ol>
    <li>
        To do this, go to the <code>Mercury iTC</code> and go to the home panel. 
    </li>
    <li>
        Select the <code>Control</code> button which will bring up the <code>Control Loop Configuration</code> panel. Under the <code>Sensor</code> drop down menu, select <code>Pressure_DB5</code> which will allow you to adjust the needle valve opening percentage and/or the pressure set point. 
    </li>
    <li>
        In this case, adjacent to <code>Flow(%)</code> and to the right of <code>Manual/Automatic</code>, select the box with numerical values to bring up a keypad at which point you can input a specific needle valve opening to set it to. In this case, set it to <code> 99.9 </code> and press <code>OK</code> to confirm. At this step, the <code>Set Point</code> value which controls the pressure should now be <code>Disabled</code> (if the system was previously set to an automatic needle valve opening to hold a specific pressure). 
    </li>
</ol>






<b><br><br> 
    Step 4. Wait for up to 45 minutes to ensure that the majority of the gas charge has been returned to the storage tank. This is confirmed when the sample temperature is above 5K. At the end of this period the dial gauge on the storage tank should read approximately 0.45 bar gauge and the VTI pumping line pressure sensor should read approximately 0.0 mbar.
</b>

<ol>
    <li>
        Note. In the case of an unexpected warm up during a power outage, and the compressor and chiller have been off for a significant amount of time, the sample temperature may be already be higher than 5K and is not a reliable gauge for if a majority of the Helium gas has been returned to the storage tank. 
    </li>
    <li>
        The storage tank dial gauge is immediately to the right of the storage tank on the cart. For pressure in units of <code>bar</code> look at the position of the needle relative to the <code>red</code> markings. Note that in between the marked numbers (ie, 0, 0.5, 1.0, ...), the larger (smaller) ticks are in steps of 0.1 bar (0.05 bar). 
    </li> 
    <li>
        The VTI pumping line pressure can be read by looking at the <code>Mercury iTC</code> home panel in the bottom right corner under <code>Pressure_DB5.p</code> which gives a numerical value for the VTI pumping line pressure in units of mB.

<b><br><br> 
    Step 5. Close the NW25 VTI pumping port valve. Do not close the NW16 VTI return line valve and/or the zeolite trap exit valve. 
</b>
<ol>
    <li>
        The NW25 VTI pumping port valve is located at the top of the cryostat. It is distinguished by its relatively large knobbed valve and NW25 vacuum pipe tube connected to the nXDS circulation pump on the cart. 
    </li>
    <li>
        Close this by turning the knob clockwise (righty tighty). 
    </li>
    <li>
        Leave the following valves open during this process. 
    </li>
</ol>


<b><br><br> 
    Step 6. Close the storage tank isolation valve and fit the anti-tamper clip. 
</b>
<ol>
    <li>
        Remove the red anti-tamper clip.
    </li>
    <li>
        Turn the storage tank isolation valve clockwise until tight. The marking should change from a red <code>OPEN</code> to a blue <code>CLOSED</code>.
    </li>
    <li>
        Re-fit the anti-tamper clip by sliding it back on in the same position (note a pin that needs to be inserted in)
    </li>
</ol>


<b><br><br> 
    Step 7. Turn off the nXDS circulation pump. 
</b>



<b><br><br> 
    Step 8. Turn off the PTR compressor and leave the system to warm to room temperature.
</b>





<b><br><br> 
    Step 9 (Optional). Warm up can be accelerated by carefully adding approximately 1 litre of dry nitrogen gas to the OVC when all the system temperature sensors read above 90 K. Do not attempt to accelerate warm up by artificially heating the OVC above 30 Celsius – This may damage the system.
</b>
<ul>
    <li>
        Typically, we do not do this. 
    </li>
</ul>



<b><br><br> 
    Step 10. Wait for all system temperature sensors to read greater than 285 K.
</b>
<ul>
    <li>
        This can take from 1-2 days to complete if starting from base temperature (~ 1.45 K),

    <b><br><br> 
        Step 11. Connect a turbo pump to the NW16 zeolite trap pump out valve (<u>with the trap pump out valve still closed!!</u>). 
    </b>

    <ol>
        <li>
            We have access to a <code>Leybold PT 70 F Compact Turbomolecular</code> pump (from now on referred to as the Turbo). This is typically stored on or near the sink/counter behind the cart in Room 263. Similarly, we also have an additional <code>nXDS dry scroll</code>nXDS  that is likewise stored in a similar location (not to be confused with the one mounted on the cart, and from now on referred to as the roughing pump). <br><br>

            We would like to connect these together (typically in series) to perform the pumping of the zeolite trap as the off-gassing from the zeolite trap can overwhelm the Turbo (Turbo vacuums only work well in high vacuum environments).

            Likewise, these are used in conjunction with two gauges which can read the vacuum pressure of the system. 

            
        </li>


        <li>
            If the connections on the Turbo are as pictured in Fig. then proceed to the next step. If not, use NW25 flanges, o-rings, and converters to set up the connections. The important aspects are the connections to the two gauges. 
        </li>


        <li>
            Take one of the <code>NW25 vacuum pipe tubes</code> (preferably one of the shorter ones) to connect the zeolite trap pump out port to the turbo pump.

    <b><br><br> 
        Step 12. Turn on the zeolite trap heater and wait 1 hour.

    <ol>
        <li> 
        Adjacent to the zeolite trap heat is a power brick with electrical plug. Plug this in to turn on the trap heater; unplug it to turn off the heater.

    </ol> 


    <b><br><br> 
        Step 13. Turn on the turbo pump and slowly open the zeolite trap pump out valve in order to remove contaminants from the VTI and zeolite trap. <u><i>
            Do not open the zeolite trap inlet valve as this would remove the pure helium from the circulation pump exhaust.</i>

            This step has typically taken us 1-2 days to perform from start to finish.

    <b><br><br> 
        Step 15. Check that the VTI pumping line pressure sensor reads between 0 and 0.5 mbar and then close the zeolite trap pump out valve and remove the turbo pump.
    </b>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Before closing the zeolite trap exit valve, check the pressure reading on the turbo pump; this should be in the low 10-3 mbar range or better. The VTI pumping line pressure gauge should read 0.0 mbar (+ 0.5 mbar). Always make a written note of the readings for future reference. Compare this VTI pumping line pressure reading to that taken in step 4 (see note c)), and follow one of the two courses of action below as appropriate:
            <ol>
                <li>
                    If the reading in step 15 is the same as in step 4 (to within ±0.2 mbar), then any problem with the reading is likely to be related to a problem with the transducer or the calibration of the ITC. If the pressure reading is within the range -4.5 mbar to 5 mbar tap Pressure.p on the Mercury iTC home screen, followed by Cal. adjust. Use offset to reset the reading to 0.0 mbar (see the Mercury iTC manual for more details of how to calibrate the display reading). If you need to do this every time the system is warmed up, you should consult Oxford instruments for further advice.

    Graphene is a two dimensional hexagonal arrangement of carbon atoms. It has the unique properties of having an energy band structure that's linear rather than parabolic (at "low" energies) and is a zero-gap semiconductor. These two properties lead to a resistivity versus gate voltage curve that exhibits a sharp peak for undoped graphene at zero gate voltage (\(V_G\)) that then slopes down towards zero as \(V_G\) increases/decreases.
</p> 
</p> 
To experimentally verify this behavior, we fabricated a graphene field effect transistor (FET) and measured the resistivity of the graphene channel as a function of the gate voltage. We fabricated two graphene FETs and performed back gate resistivity measurements and found that for one sample (3A) that there may be a resistivity dependence on \(V_G\) that weakly agrees with the expected behavior although curve appears to be broadened and our data is overall noisy. We then discuss the possible reasons: gate leakage in our samples, non ideal graphene samples,

            Proper monolayer graphene is a two dimensional, single layer of hexagonal honeycomb arrangement of carbon atoms. Due to this structure, graphene has some significant electronic properties such as high electron mobility on the order of 15,000 cm\(^2\)/Vs. Additionally, graphene is a semiconductor with zero-gap between the valence and conduction band (which in this case would make it more like a metal).
        </p> 
        <p>
            The energy-momentum dispersion relation takes the linear form
            $$
                E = \hbar k c_* \qquad c_* \approx 10^6\text{m/s}
            $$
            akin to the dispersion relation for relativistic massless particles like photons for low energies near the Dirac points, the points where the valence and conduction bands meet. We can see that the typical parabolic bands are to first order replaced by linear cones, illustrating the linear energy-momentum dispersion relation. 
            <!-- \begin{figure}[H]

        <p> 
            Likewise for low energies, from the linear energy momentum dispersion relation, the density of states as a function of energy is given approximately by \(\rho(E) \propto |E|\) <!--\cite{Novoselov}-->. Since the number density of carriers is given by
            $$
                n = \int_{-\infty}^E \rho(E)F(E)\,dE
            $$
            where \(\rho\) is the density of states and \(F(E)\) is the Fermi-Dirac distribution, as the Fermi energy sweeps through the conduction and valence bands, the cone shapes indicate that the number of charge carriers (holes for the valence band and electrons for the conduction band) will decrease as the Fermi energy approaches the Dirac points and increase as it moves further away.

            A graphene field effect transistor is a field effect transistor where the channel is replaced with a sample of graphene. 
        </p>
        <p>
            When we apply a voltage to the gate, the electric field effect shifts the position of the Fermi energy by inducing a doping of electrons or holes in the graphene. The number of available states will in turn increase as the Fermi energy moves away from the Dirac points which increases the conductivity. Conversely, as the Fermi energy approaches the Dirac point, the number of states in principal approaches zero which means that the conductivity goes towards zero, or equivalently the resistance increases to infinity. 
            
            <!-- This idea is visualized in Figure \ref{fig:resistivity_curve} which gives the resistivity as a function of applied gate voltage which demonstrates a sharp peak \cite[pg. 667]{Novoselov} -->
            
            For few-layer graphene, the resistivity tends towards the order of 100 ohms for high gate voltage and tends towards orders of kilo-ohms as the resistivity approaches its peak [Novoselov].
        </p>
        <p>
            A model describing this effect is presented in Novoselov et. al where the graphene is treated as a two dimensional metal with the conductance band and valence bands overlapping. When a gate voltage \(V_G\) is applied, the subsequent electric field induces a charge density \(n\) in the graphene where <i>n</i> is given by 
            $$
                n = \frac{\varepsilon_0 \varepsilon V_G}{te}
            $$
            with \(\varepsilon_0, \varepsilon\) are the permitivities of free space and Si\(\text{O}_2\), <i>e</i> is the charge of the electron, and <i>t</i> is the depth of the insulating layer. As \(V_G\) goes towards zero, <i>n</i> goes to zero and hence the resistivity increases towards infinity. Likewise, as \(V_G\) increases or decreases further away, <i>n</i> increases and the resistivity will instead decrease.

            We prepared rectangular wafers approximately 1.5 cm by 2 cm in size from a 3 inch diameter silicon wafer marked with a grid of letters and numbers which allows for recalling the location of graphene samples. The silicon wafer consists of highly doped silicon (Si++) with a thin surface coat of silicon dioxide (SiO2) which acts as a dielectric. We made the cuts by scoring the wafers with a diamond tipped pen to then break the wafer along the scored lines using a small wire taped to a flat surface as a fulcrum.

            Once washed, we exfoliated graphenium graphite, a type of highly oriented pyrolytic graphite which lends itself to exfoliation, onto the sample via the Scotch tape method where we loaded flakes of graphenium and pressed and distributed the graphite in scotch tape the goal of which is to lift and distribute layers of graphite and hopefully achieve an incredibly thin layer. After distributing the graphite we then place our wafer, face side down, into the tape as to transfer the graphite onto the wafer.

            Lastly, we looked for samples of graphene using a microscope, searching for patches with a color similar to the substrate, that is, a color that is a darker blue to purple. Though ideal candidates would appear nearly transparent.

    <h4>
        Photolithography
    </h4>
    <p>
        The next process involved photolithography which prints a gold-titanium circuit onto the wafer with the graphene sample at the center of the circuit. All of the following steps takes place in a room with a special filter that filters out UV light. 
    

    
    <ol>
    <li> First, we applied a coating of (positive) photoresist, a light sensitive chemical that becomes soluble to the developer after being exposed to ultraviolet light, to the wafers which took place in three stages.  </li> 
    <ul>

        <li>First, we placed our wafer into the spin-coat machine, applying a vacuum seal to hold the wafer in place and applied 3 drops of primer to fully coat the wafer. Then we set the machine to run at 4000 rotations per minute (rpm) for 40 seconds. </li>
        <li>Next, we applied 3 drops of photoresist to the wafer and ran the machine at 7000 rpm for 60 seconds. </li>
        <li>Finally, we soft baked the wafer on a hot plate at 80\(^\circ\)  C for two minutes as to stabilize the photoresist for easier handling in the next mask-aligning and exposure step.
        </li>

    </ul>

    
    <li>Next, we aligned a mask with a circuit pattern over our graphene sample and exposed the wafer to ultraviolet (UV) light. The UV light makes the photoresist soluble to the developer so that in the developing step, the parts of the wafer not covered by the mask will wash off exposing the silicon dioxide wafer substrate. </li>
    
        <ul>
            <li>We loaded the wafer into the mask aligner and located the general location of the graphene sample using the gold letter and number markings on the wafer.</li>
            <li>We loaded the mask into the holder which uses a vacuum to hold the mask in place. Keeping one hand underneath the mask, in the case of vacuum failure, we inserted the mask into the aligner above the sample. </li>
            <li>Next, we aligned the graphene sample with a finer circuit pattern using a combination of coarse lever controls which move the objectives and fine levers which move the stage in the X and Y directions.</li>
           <li>After having aligned the graphene sample into the center of the circuit pattern, we expose the wafer to UV light for 4.25 seconds.</li>
        </ul>
    
    
    
    <p>

     <li>Next, we developed the wafers which allowed for the exposed photoresist to be washed off and harden the remaining photoresist.  This step took place in three stages. </li>
     <ul>
            <li> 
         First, we placed the wafers into a dish with developer for 50 seconds. The developer used was diluted from the original concentration with milli-q water using a ratio of 1 part original developer to 6 parts milli-q water.</li>
        <li>
        After that, we rinsed the wafers in de-ionized water for 40 seconds before drying the samples using jets of air. </li>
        <li> 
        Then we hard baked the sample at 100$^\circ$ C for two minutes which solidifies the non-exposed photoresist. </li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    </ol>

        Next, we evaporated 4 nm of titanium and afterwards 40 nm of gold onto the wafers. The specific evaporator used is an electron beam evaporator. First, the samples are loaded via retaining pins into a dish which is then attached into the interior of the evaporator and small amounts of titanium and gold are loaded into their respective crucibles. The evaporator is then closed and a vacuum is applied. Then, via a tungsten filament, beam of electrons is sent towards the crucibles heating the metals up and turning them into vapors which then condense and form a thin film onto the wafer.

        Lastly, we perform the lift off wash for the wafers which removes the irrelevant gold, that is, the gold that lays on top of the photoresist, without removing the gold that forms the electrodes. As the photoresist used in this lab is acetone soluble, the lift off wash consists of placing the wafers into a dish of acetone which starts to eat away the photoresist. Then using a syringe, we applied more pressurized jets of acetone to encourage removal of more stubborn bits of gold.

    <p>
        Our goal was to measure the resistivity of the graphene FET as a function of applied gate voltage. After making corrections to our samples (after initial poor measurements), we got the following data, which we take and analyze using Python.

        Curve Fitting

        <div id = "flex_item_1"> 
        <p>
            Since resistivity versus gate voltage plot for graphene was expected to exhibit a shark peak around the Fermi energy, we tried to fit a "peak" function to the data. We ended up choosing a Lorentzian function, although a Gaussian could work as well (or even a Voigt function which is a convolution of a Gaussian and a Lorentzian). That is, we used a function of the following form
            $$
                L(x) =
                \frac{1}{\pi}
                \frac{\frac{1}{2}\Gamma}{(x-x_0)^2 + (\frac{1}{2}\Gamma)^2} + h
            $$
            with \(\Gamma, x_0, h\) as fittable parameters and fitted it to the scattered points by minimizing the mean square error. In particular, we loaded in the data, which we have stored in CSV form from our LabView output as a <code>Pandas DataFrame</code>. Extracting the array data we then use <code>scipy.optimize.curve_fit</code> to find the parameters that best fit the data and then plot the resulting graphs with <code>Matplotlib.pyplot</code>.
