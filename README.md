# Introduction 

## Homepage 
The homepage consists of a bunch of tiles, each of which is a clickable link. These tiles correspond to each machine/topic of interest in the lab. Clicking on these tiles will then lead to a "subfolder" which contains the SOP's specific to each machine. 

Example. 
- The first square at the time of writing this is "Oxford Teslatron PT Closed Cycle Cryostat" with a picture of the cryostat. Clicking on it will lead to a subfolder with more tiles. Each tile then corresponds to a specific procedure ie, "Warmup", "Cooldown", etc. 

### Modifications/Code 
To add a square to this main front page (such as when wanting to add a new machine, but not a specific SOP for an existing machine, see below), go to the csulb-nanoelectronics.github.io folder. This is assuming that you already have Github installed on your computer signed into the student nanoelectronics account (with a local copy of the repository). When in doubt, make a new branch to work on to test changes before pushing to the main branch. 

Once there, go to """my_collections""" and then `_portfolio'.
