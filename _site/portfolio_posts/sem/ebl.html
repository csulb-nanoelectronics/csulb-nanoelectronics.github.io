        Preparing Sample for Lithography
    </h2>
    <p>
        Before taking your sample to the scanning electron microscope (SEM), you must cover your sample in two layers of positive tone, electron resist using the spincoater.
        <ol>
            <li>
                Apply a few drops of 495 polymethylmethaceylate (PMMA) onto the sample and spin for 1 min at 3000 rpm.
            </li>
            <li>
                Let the sample sit for 5 min.
            </li>
            <li>
                Apply an additional couple of drops of 950 PMMA and spin for 1 min at 4000 rpm.
            </li>
            <li>
                Bake the sample for 5 mins at 180 &#8451;
            </li>
        </ol>
        Now you’re almost ready to head over to the SEM. Before heading over, make sure to collect the sample puck, a pair of tweezers, a flat-head screw- driver, and the notebook to write beam currents in. The sample puck is how you will fix your sample onto the SEM stage, see Fig. 4. Additionally, prior to going to the SEM, take note of where you set your origin in the DesignCAD file.

            Now the excitement begins!
            <ol>
                <li>
                    We will be operating the two right-most computers, shown in Fig.1. The right most computer should be already on, if not turn it on. This computer directly interfaces with the SEM. Turn on the computer corresponding to the middle screen by turning on the black left most computer (on the ground). It should have a label with Dr. Ojeda-Aristizabal's name on it. This computer will run the NPGS file – hereafter we’ll refer to this computer as the NPGS computer. When turning on the NPGS computer the operating system should start with Windows 7. If Windows 10 is powered up, then restart the computer and select Windows 7 at the partition window. 
                </li><br> 
                <li>
                    When the computers are on, log in using the `supervisor’ user, the password is 'supervisor'.
                </li><br> 
                <li>
                    On the SEM computer, the software xT Microscope should already be open. If not, open the software located on the desktop, which will then require the same login information. Once the software is open, click Start UI at the top of the screen. The log-in information is the same all throughout. 
                </li>
                <li>
                    We begin by first clicking the Home stage button. Homing the stage brings the platform, where we place our samples, to its origin.
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <b> Note! </b> The bottom right panel is a live view of the SEM stage. If it is paused, indicated by the presence of a green pause sign, un- pause it by first clicking on the paused window and then selecting the pause icon next to the camera icon at the top. See Fig. 2. If it looks like the homing process is going to crash the stage into the objective, you can stop the process at any point by pressing the ESC key on the keyboard. It is highly recommended to have your finger at the ready above this key, just in case of emergency.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    The system should be pumped. Click the <b> Pump </b> button in the top right corner of the window, see Fig. 3(b). To check the status of the chamber, look to the bottom right corner of Fig. 3(a). The square at the bottom right corner will appear red if vented. If the chamber is already vented, proceed to the next step. 
                </li>

                <li>
                    Put on gloves, and then open the chamber door. Place the puck on the SEM stage, orienting it such that the Faraday cage is pointing away from you, see Fig. 4.
                </li>



                <li>
                    Close the chamber door and click the <b>Pump</b> button, directly to the left of the <b>Vent</b> button. To help the pumps create a vacuum seal, hold pressure to the door until the pressure inside the chamber begins to drop. The pressure is shown in the same status panel at the bottom right-hand side of the screen, see Fig. 5 (a).
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            The chamber will reach vacuum once the colored square indicator turns green. As of July 2022, it is recommended to wait until the pressure reaches at least \(2.0 \times 10^{-5}\) mbar before continuing. This may take a few minutes.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>



                <li>
                    After reaching base pressure and making sure the bottom right panel is not paused, we can bring the platform up. We do so by holding down the middle mouse wheel and moving the mouse upwards. The higher you move the mouse, the faster the stage moves. You’ll want to move the stage up to the yellow marker in the camera panel. This indicates 10mm from the objective, see Fig.5(b). Once again, be cautious as you could drive the stage into the objective!
                </li>


                <li>
                    Now we may turn on the HV. Before doing so, check that the HV is set to 30.0 kV and the spot size to 3, see Fig. 5 (c). When ready, click on <b>HV</b>.
                </li>



                <li>
                    We should now be able to see the silver paste. We’ll first want to make a clear image of the paste. First focus the image, and then zoom in and focus in stages until you get a clear image at a minimum of ∼ 5.0 um. 
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            To zoom, use the magnification knob directly below the comput- ers, see Fig. 6 (a). To know how zoomed in you are, there is a scale bar at the bottom of the image panel as shown in Fig. 6 (b).
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            To focus you can either use the Coarse and Fine knobs adjacent to the magnification knob, or drag and right-click the mouse side to side to focus.
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                </li>



                <li>
                    Once we have a clear picture of the silver paste, we can set the working distance. The working distance is how far away the beam is focused and thus needs to correspond to the distance between the stage and the objective when everything is in focus. We typically want this distance to be 7mm. To set the working distance, first navigate to the <b>Work</b> panel in the top right corner, look for a purple gear as shown in Fig. 7 (a). Under the stage panel in the <b>Work</b> panel, click on Coordinates shown in Fig. 7 (b). Now click on the <b>Couple Z to FWD </b> icon on the top left bar directly under <b>Scan</b>. The <b>Couple Z to FWD </b> icon is an objective with a red arrow going through it, see Fig.7(c). Now that the distance is coupled, we set our working distance to 7 mm by changing the z-value in the <b>Coordinate</b> panel. Before changing the distance make sure the <b>Absolute</b> button is activated, NOT the <b>Relative</b> one! This is underlined in Fig. 7 (b). When setting the distance, again be at the ready with the ESC button just in case the stage gets too close to the objective.
                </li><br> 


                <li>
                    After setting the working distance, navigate over to the Faraday cage. To move the stage, its best to zoom out and then click on the image where you want to go. Be careful not to zoom out too far, you don’t want to accidentally expose your sample. Center the image above the hole of the Faraday cage and zoom in as much as possible. The Faraday cage is shown in Fig. 8 (a).
                </li><br> 



                <li>
                    We want to measure the current for different spot sizes. Although we use the same spot sizes for each session, the measured currents for each size will vary from session to session. First blank the beam by clicking on the icon directly below the Help drop down menu. You will know the beam is blanked when the image disappears. With the Keithley 6485 Picoammeter on, press the ZCHK button, see Fig. 8 (b). The picoammeter sits directly below the SEM computer display, as shown in Fig. 1. When we press the ZCHK button, it sets the reading of the picoammeter to zero. Un-blank the beam and set the spot size to 3.0. To change the spot size, see Fig.5(c). Take note of the spot size and the values read by the picoammeter in the SEM notebook. Do this for each spot size up to 6.0. The units read from the picoammeter will be in nano-amps, however the run file for the NPGS will need it in pico-amps.
                </li><br> 


                <li>
                    With each change of the spot size, the fine focusing is lost. It is worth revisiting the silver paste and refocus before navigating to the sample.

                <li>
                    First we need to align the wafer, navigate to one of the large letter markers, e.g. A1 or H1, at the bottom of your wafer. To align the wafer we will use the <b>Alignment Wizard</b> feature located under the Stage drop down menu, see Fig. 9 (a). This feature will rotate the stage such that the markers are properly aligned parallel to the horizon. Follow the steps provided by the <b>Alignment Wizard</b> and when choosing two points, its best to select two small markers several spaces apart. To make sure the alignment rotates the sample the correct way choose points from left to right, shown in Fig. 9 (b). NOTE! Before proceeding with the alignment, make sure to blank the beam because the whole stage will rotate as soon as you begin. Blanking the beam ensures you don’t accidentally expose your sample. The beam blank icon is shown in Fig. 9 (b).
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Often, you may need to align the wafer a couple times before proper alignment is achieved. A good trick is to use the edges of the viewing window as reference to check if the alignment was successful.

                <!-- Step 2 -->
                <li>
                    Once aligned, un-blank the beam to recover the image.
                </li>



                <!-- Step 3 -->
                <li>
                    Navigate to your sample’s origin (originally set in the CAD design.) When moving the stage, make sure to blank the beam so that you don’t expose the wafer. There are two ways you can navigate to your sample:
                    <ul>
                        You can move the stage using the coordinates panel previously used when setting the working distance. Now, instead of using Absolute click on Relative, see Fig. 7. This will move the stage relative to your current position. Input the x and y values to nav- igate to your origin, make sure to take note of the units. Some- times the micro-manipulators drift, if the drift consistently leads you astray use the following technique:
                    </ul>
                    <ul>
                        You can manually shift the stage using the micro-manipulators on the door of the SEM, see Fig. 1. Make sure to keep track of how far you have moved.
                    </ul>
                </li>



                <!-- Step 4 -->
                <li>
                    Once at the origin of your design, blank the beam and click on Ex- ternal under the Scan drop down menu, see Fig. 10 (a). Next flip the switch to turn on the external beam blanker, directly to the right of the picoammeter, see Fig. 10. Lastly, turn the dial to external: EXT.
                </li>



                <!-- Step 5 -->
                <li>
                    Now we need to prepare the run file. Using either a past run file or template, open the file by clicking <b>Run File Editor</b> to the left in the NPGS menu, see Fig. 11.
                </li>


                <li>
                    First we edit the parameters for the alignment windows under the <b>Alignment</b> entity type, the first box shown in Fig.12. Upload the correct CAD design by double clicking on the pattern name and locat- ing the appropriate design CAD file. For this entity type we’ll only be editing the first four layers, i.e. layers 2-5. Each of these layers should have selected Window in the first drop down menu, the rest of the layers should show Skip. All of the windows’ layers will have the same following parameters shown in Table 1 and Fig. 12 (a).
                </li>


                <li>
                    Next, we edit the Pattern entity type, directly below the Alignment entity type, shown in Fig. 12 (b). Like before, make sure to load in the correct CAD design file by clicking on the pattern name and choosing the correct file. The first 8 layers should all read Skip. Layers 10, 11, and 12 should all read Pause First. Each of these layers will have their own set of parameters:

                    Once everything checks out, under the Custom Commands section of the NPGS menu click on Set WD=7mm to set the working distance to 7 mm and then click on NPGS Mode, see Fig. 14. Selecting NPGS Mode will allow NPGS to take over the SEM.

                <li>
                    Check that your spot size and magnification are appropriate, they should respectively be 3 and 1000.
                </li>


                <li>
                    Now we can start by clicking Process Run File!
                </li>


                <li>
                    Four windows should appear corresponding to the four windows from the CAD design. Here, we want to adjust the windows so that the markers are fully visible and within the window. Certain keys will create a better picture, enlarge the windows, or change the scan rate. When you’re happy with the placement and alignment of the windows press Enter on your keyboard. Note, sometimes markers will not be visible if they are next to some thick features as the images are contrast based. Below are important keys and their actions:
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            P: makes windows larger
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            A: auto-contrast
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            space-bar: re-scans
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>


                <li>
                    Once the windows are aligned, NPGS will ask if you want to recalculate the matrix, select yes.
                </li>


                <li>
                    Before hitting the space-bar to continue for each layer, make sure to change and update the spot-size and magnification because the program will not automatically update it.
                </li>


                <li>
                    Once completed, click on SEM Mode in the NPGS menu to return control to the SEM computer. Quickly blank the beam and turn off the beam as to not over expose your sample.
                </li>


                <li>
                    Turn the dial back to OFF, and flip the switch back on the external beam blanker. Lastly, under Scan select Full Frame.
                </li>

                <li>
                    Make sure the chamber camera is not paused, and then home the stage. Afterwards you may vent the chamber and pull out the puck and sam- ple.
                </li>


                <li>
                    Leave the chamber vented and log out of the program by clicking STOP UI in the top right corner. Make sure to leave the SEM com- puter on but log off the NPGS computer.
                </li>

        Developing Sample After Lithography
    </h2>

    After exposing the positive tone, electron resist at the SEM, we must develop the lithography using a solution of IPA and MIBK. <br>
    <ol><br>
        <li>
            If there is no more MIBK:IPA solution, create more using a 1:3 ratio.
        </li><br>
        <li>
            Place exposed wafer in MIBK:IPA solution for 25 seconds (time may vary).
        </li><br>
        <li>
            Wash sample in IPA for 25 seconds, and then dry off with compressed air.
