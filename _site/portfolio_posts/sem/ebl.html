        Preparing Sample for Lithography
    </h2>
    <p>
        Before taking your sample to the scanning electron microscope (SEM), you must cover your sample in two layers of positive tone, electron resist using the spincoater.
        <ol>
            <li>
                Apply a few drops of 495 polymethylmethaceylate (PMMA) onto the sample and spin for 1 min at 3000 rpm.
            </li>
            <li>
                Let the sample sit for 5 min.
            </li>
            <li>
                Apply an additional couple of drops of 950 PMMA and spin for 1 min at 4000 rpm.
            </li>
            <li>
                Bake the sample for 5 mins at 180 &#8451;
            </li>
        </ol>
        Now you’re almost ready to head over to the SEM. Before heading over, make sure to collect the sample puck, a pair of tweezers, a flat-head screw- driver, and the notebook to write beam currents in. The sample puck is how you will fix your sample onto the SEM stage, see Fig. 4. Additionally, prior to going to the SEM, take note of where you set your origin in the DesignCAD file.

                    We will be operating the two right-most computers, shown in Fig.1. The right most computer should be already on, if not turn it on. This computer directly interfaces with the SEM. Turn on the computer corresponding to the middle screen by turning on the black left most computer (on the ground). It should have a label with Dr. Ojeda-Aristizabal's name on it. This computer will run the NPGS file – hereafter we’ll refer to this computer as the NPGS computer. When turning on the NPGS computer the operating system should start with Windows 7. If Windows 10 is powered up, then restart the computer and select Windows 7 at the partition window.

                <li>
                    When the computers are on, log in using the `supervisor’ user, the password is 'supervisor'.
                </li><br> 
                <li>
                    On the SEM computer, the software xT Microscope should already be open. If not, open the software located on the desktop, which will then require the same login information. Once the software is open, click Start UI at the top of the screen. The log-in information is the same all throughout.

                <li>
                    We begin by first clicking the Home stage button. Homing the stage brings the platform, where we place our samples, to its origin.
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <b> Note! </b> The bottom right panel is a live view of the SEM stage. If it is paused, indicated by the presence of a green pause sign, un- pause it by first clicking on the paused window and then selecting the pause icon next to the camera icon at the top. See Fig. 2. If it looks like the homing process is going to crash the stage into the objective, you can stop the process at any point by pressing the ESC key on the keyboard. It is highly recommended to have your finger at the ready above this key, just in case of emergency.

    Graphene is a two dimensional hexagonal arrangement of carbon atoms. It has the unique properties of having an energy band structure that's linear rather than parabolic (at "low" energies) and is a zero-gap semiconductor. These two properties lead to a resistivity versus gate voltage curve that exhibits a sharp peak for undoped graphene at zero gate voltage (\(V_G\)) that then slopes down towards zero as \(V_G\) increases/decreases.
</p> 
</p> 
To experimentally verify this behavior, we fabricated a graphene field effect transistor (FET) and measured the resistivity of the graphene channel as a function of the gate voltage. We fabricated two graphene FETs and performed back gate resistivity measurements and found that for one sample (3A) that there may be a resistivity dependence on \(V_G\) that weakly agrees with the expected behavior although curve appears to be broadened and our data is overall noisy. We then discuss the possible reasons: gate leakage in our samples, non ideal graphene samples,

            We prepared rectangular wafers approximately 1.5 cm by 2 cm in size from a 3 inch diameter silicon wafer marked with a grid of letters and numbers which allows for recalling the location of graphene samples. The silicon wafer consists of highly doped silicon (Si++) with a thin surface coat of silicon dioxide (SiO2) which acts as a dielectric. We made the cuts by scoring the wafers with a diamond tipped pen to then break the wafer along the scored lines using a small wire taped to a flat surface as a fulcrum.
        </p>
        <p>
            Once washed, we exfoliated graphenium graphite, a type of highly oriented pyrolytic graphite which lends itself to exfoliation, onto the sample via the Scotch tape method where we loaded flakes of graphenium and pressed and distributed the graphite in scotch tape the goal of which is to lift and distribute layers of graphite and hopefully achieve an incredibly thin layer. After distributing the graphite we then place our wafer, face side down, into the tape as to transfer the graphite onto the wafer.
        </p>
        <p>
            Lastly, we looked for samples of graphene using a microscope, searching for patches with a color similar to the substrate, that is, a color that is a darker blue to purple. Though ideal candidates would appear nearly transparent.

    <h4>
        Photolithography
    </h4>
    <p>
        The next process involved photolithography which prints a gold-titanium circuit onto the wafer with the graphene sample at the center of the circuit. All of the following steps takes place in a room with a special filter that filters out UV light. 
    

    
    <ol>
    <li> First, we applied a coating of (positive) photoresist, a light sensitive chemical that becomes soluble to the developer after being exposed to ultraviolet light, to the wafers which took place in three stages.  </li> 
    <ul>

        <li>First, we placed our wafer into the spin-coat machine, applying a vacuum seal to hold the wafer in place and applied 3 drops of primer to fully coat the wafer. Then we set the machine to run at 4000 rotations per minute (rpm) for 40 seconds. </li>
        <li>Next, we applied 3 drops of photoresist to the wafer and ran the machine at 7000 rpm for 60 seconds. </li>
        <li>Finally, we soft baked the wafer on a hot plate at 80\(^\circ\)  C for two minutes as to stabilize the photoresist for easier handling in the next mask-aligning and exposure step.
        </li>

    </ul>

    
    <li>Next, we aligned a mask with a circuit pattern over our graphene sample and exposed the wafer to ultraviolet (UV) light. The UV light makes the photoresist soluble to the developer so that in the developing step, the parts of the wafer not covered by the mask will wash off exposing the silicon dioxide wafer substrate. </li>
    
        <ul>
            <li>We loaded the wafer into the mask aligner and located the general location of the graphene sample using the gold letter and number markings on the wafer.</li>
            <li>We loaded the mask into the holder which uses a vacuum to hold the mask in place. Keeping one hand underneath the mask, in the case of vacuum failure, we inserted the mask into the aligner above the sample. </li>
            <li>Next, we aligned the graphene sample with a finer circuit pattern using a combination of coarse lever controls which move the objectives and fine levers which move the stage in the X and Y directions.</li>
           <li>After having aligned the graphene sample into the center of the circuit pattern, we expose the wafer to UV light for 4.25 seconds.</li>
        </ul>
    
    
    
    <p>

     <li>Next, we developed the wafers which allowed for the exposed photoresist to be washed off and harden the remaining photoresist.  This step took place in three stages. </li>
     <ul>
            <li> 
         First, we placed the wafers into a dish with developer for 50 seconds. The developer used was diluted from the original concentration with milli-q water using a ratio of 1 part original developer to 6 parts milli-q water.</li>
        <li>
        After that, we rinsed the wafers in de-ionized water for 40 seconds before drying the samples using jets of air. </li>
        <li> 
        Then we hard baked the sample at 100$^\circ$ C for two minutes which solidifies the non-exposed photoresist. </li>
    </ul>

    </ol>

        Next, we evaporated 4 nm of titanium and afterwards 40 nm of gold onto the wafers. The specific evaporator used is an electron beam evaporator. First, the samples are loaded via retaining pins into a dish which is then attached into the interior of the evaporator and small amounts of titanium and gold are loaded into their respective crucibles. The evaporator is then closed and a vacuum is applied. Then, via a tungsten filament, beam of electrons is sent towards the crucibles heating the metals up and turning them into vapors which then condense and form a thin film onto the wafer.

        Lastly, we perform the lift off wash for the wafers which removes the irrelevant gold, that is, the gold that lays on top of the photoresist, without removing the gold that forms the electrodes. As the photoresist used in this lab is acetone soluble, the lift off wash consists of placing the wafers into a dish of acetone which starts to eat away the photoresist. Then using a syringe, we applied more pressurized jets of acetone to encourage removal of more stubborn bits of gold.

        Data Analysis
    </h2>

    <p>
        Our goal was to measure the resistivity of the graphene FET as a function of applied gate voltage. After making corrections to our samples (after initial poor measurements), we got the following data, which we take and analyze using Python.

        Curve Fitting
    </h4>

    <div id = "resistivity_container"> 
        <div id = "flex_item_1"> 
        <p>
            Since resistivity versus gate voltage plot for graphene was expected to exhibit a shark peak around the Fermi energy, we tried to fit a "peak" function to the data. We ended up choosing a Lorentzian function, although a Gaussian could work as well (or even a Voigt function which is a convolution of a Gaussian and a Lorentzian). That is, we used a function of the following form
            $$
                L(x) =
                \frac{1}{\pi}
                \frac{\frac{1}{2}\Gamma}{(x-x_0)^2 + (\frac{1}{2}\Gamma)^2} + h
            $$
            with \(\Gamma, x_0, h\) as fittable parameters and fitted it to the scattered points by minimizing the mean square error. In particular, we loaded in the data, which we have stored in CSV form from our LabView output as a <code>Pandas DataFrame</code>. Extracting the array data we then use <code>scipy.optimize.curve_fit</code> to find the parameters that best fit the data and then plot the resulting graphs with <code>Matplotlib.pyplot</code>.
